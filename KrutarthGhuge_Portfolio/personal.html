            Hi there!<br />I am Krutarth Ghuge, aged 21. I was born in the
            suburban region of the metropolitan city of Mumbai, India. I
            completed my kindergarten years of schooling in Mumbai itself, after
            which me and my mother moved to Nashik, a developing city then in
            the same state, Maharashtra. I then completed the rest of my
            schooling upto High School from the school Fravashi International
            Academy. Wherein following the British pattern education system from
            the British Council, I completed the International General
            Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) and Advanced Level (A
            LEVEL) examinations. Upon the successful completion of my High
            School education, I have moved to Canada to pursue my Bachelor's
            degree. I am currently in my 3rd year of education at Trent
            University, Peterborough, Canada; completing my Bachelor of Science
            (Honours) degree in Computer Science, specializing in Data
            Analytics, as well as doing a minor in Economics.
          </p>
          <p>
            I come from a close-knit family, with just a few members, my mother,
            my grandfather and grandmother. My mom's sister also used to stay
            with us, though after marriage she moved out. Family and relations
            matter to me a lot as I have not had a lot of people around me
            throughout - my dad passed away when I was about 4 months old, and
            since then it has been my mother taking the workload of two parents.
            Moving forward I aim to achieve my desired goals with perfection in
            order to meet my family's and my own expectations.
          </p>

          <p>
            P.S. Sorry if you believe if I went out of sync.
